This repository contains an evaluation script (evalAll.m) for the NREC

filtering labeled data when using Piotr's Image & Video Matlab Toolbox, as
modified in https://github.com/zpezz/toolbox to support additional filtering
operations. 

It also contains a script for converting the dataset's PASCAL Labels to MS-CNN
